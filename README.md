## Final Grades and Improvement Suggestions
Below are the final grades received for each assignment, along with suggestions for improvement:

- **Assignment 1**: 16/16
  - *Feedback*: Needs a top documentation block. Accessories costs were not properly calculated. [IMPROVED]

- **Assignment 2**: 16/16
  - *Feedback*: Add testing for less than 0 and for 0. [IMPROVED]

- **Assignment 3**: 7.6/8
  - *Feedback*: Needs more tests. CarWashInvoice should have about 40, and SalesQuote about 50. [IMPROVED]

- **Assignment 4**: 16/16
  - *Feedback*: GoodsAndServicesTaxCharged, ProvincialSalesTaxCharged, and SubTotal should be abstract. [IMPROVED]

- **Assignment 5**: 14/16
  - *Feedback*: Need to create actual SalesQuotes instead of rewriting the code. The Financing class should be used for payments.

- **Assignment 6**: 13/16
