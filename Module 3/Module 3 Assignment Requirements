Introduction

This phase of the project will have you automate testing by coding unit tests for your library.

Requirements

Test Project

Create a new Unit Test Project (.NET Framework) project named LastName.FirstName.Business.Testing, where “FirstName” and “LastName” correspond to your first and last names.

Name the Visual Studio Solution Assignment3FirstNameLastName, where “FirstName” and “LastName” correspond to your first and last names.

Examples

If your name is Dallas Page, the project and solution would be named:

Project: Page.Dallas.Business.Testing
Solution: Assignment3DallasPage*
Add a reference to your LastName.FirstName.Business.dll (from the previous assignment) in your Unit Test Project to access the Library classes.

Develop the required unit tests for the following classes in your library:

SalesQuote
CarWashInvoice
Financial
Create a new unit test class for each class you are testing. Ensure that all method outcomes are tested, including exceptions.

Documentation is not required for unit test class or methods.

What to Submit

Your assignment will be submitted as a .zip file and will contain one or more Visual Studio solution directories. Name the .zip file using the following naming format:

adev-2008_firstname_lastname_assignment_3.zip
The “firstname” and “lastname” parts of the file name will be substituted with your first and last names.

Each Visual Studio solution is saved to its own directory (referred to as the Solution Directory). Your submission must follow the directory structure as seen below.

You will only get one attempt to improve your grade.
